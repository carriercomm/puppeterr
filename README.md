Err
===

Install the [Err](http://gbin.github.com/err/) xmpp/irc chat bot from a Git
repository into it's own Python virtualenv.

Note: I wrote this late on a Sunday night. Though it's tested, it does not 
currently contain actual tests.

Know issues
-----------

When changing arguments passed to the virtualenv (like changing the Python version),
you'll need to remove the virtualenv by hand first. This module does not currently
detect when it needs to recreate the virtualenv from scratch.
